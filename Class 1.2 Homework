a=2
b=5
import math as mt
#this import of math as mt did not work, I had to do it again below
# not sure what are the 10 functions-only done 5

#sum,subtract,multiply, divide
print (f"the sum of a and b is {a+b},a minus b is {a-b}, a multiplied by b is {a*b}, a divided by b is {a/b}")

# exponent
import math as mt
print (f"a to the power of b is {mt.pow(a,b)} and b to the power of a is {mt.pow(b,a)}")
